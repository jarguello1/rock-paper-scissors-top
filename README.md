# rock-paper-scissors-top

Rock, Paper, Scissors project from The Odin Project. The first version of the program uses javascript to create the functionality 
of a game of rock, peper, scissors between the user and the computer. The game is played in the command line in the initial version.

The seccond version uses javascript DOM manipulation to create html items to provide a UI to play the game instead of playing it
in the commandline.
